Title: Incentivize the token (PACT) holders from the "Donor" category to increase their donation 

Short description: 
This proposal aims to encourage donors to make more donations in two ways. First, since they receive PACT in return for their donation, the purpose of this proposal is to explain to donors how PACT can be useful and the possible means of exchange. Second, it introduces the possibility of tax-deductible donations.


Scope/longer description: 
First of all, it is important to emphasize the definition of PACT tokens that allows donors to influence the protocol in different ways. The more they give, the more power they will have on the protocol. One proposal that could be made is that from a certain amount of donation, donors can move to the next level of influence and make more impactful decision. Next, for another use, it is important to know that PACT tokens are a crypto-currency based on the Ethereum blockchain, and, for another use, can be traded on crypto-currency exchanges. Finally, for a real life use, although they are rare, one can look for retailers that accept crypto-currency payments, or use a debit or credit card that converts your PACT tokens into fiat currency. It is also possible to use an electronic wallet compatible with PACT tokens to send and receive payments in PACT.
Second, in many countries, donations to charities are eligible for tax deductions. Therefore, another proposal that can be given is, as long as organizations are registered as charities, to make donations to organizations tax deductible.  


Metrics or Key Performance Indicators: 
The success numbers could be shown by calculating the evolution of the timing of donations that was recorded before and after the implementation of this proposal.
